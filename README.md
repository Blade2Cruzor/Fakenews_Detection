1. First preprocessing the input text manually (refer News_Segregation zip file)
2. Assigning boolean numerical features
3. Training a machine learning model like Logistic regression but there are many like:
 3.1 PolynomialFeatures
 3.2 Pipeline
 3.3 DecisionTreeRegressor
 3.4 MLPRegressor...
4. Predict whether the news is reliable or not
