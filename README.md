This project aims 🔎 to detect and flag fake news 🚩 using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.

# Description📝
The Fake News Detection project is all about fighting back against false information online. We're using really smart computer programs to help us spot fake news articles. <br/>
We want to give people the power to tell when news is trustworthy and when it's not.
# Features🎨
1. First preprocessing the input text manually (refer News_Segregation zip file)
2. Assigning boolean numerical features
3. Training a machine learning model like Logistic regression but there are many like:<br/>
 <I>3.1 PolynomialFeatures<br/>
 3.2 Pipeline<br/>
 3.3 DecisionTreeRegressor<br/>
 3.4 MLPRegressor...</I><br/>
4. Predict whether the news is reliable or not
